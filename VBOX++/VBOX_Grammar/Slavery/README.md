# Slavery grammar

This is a bit of a controversial feature to add, but there will be a built-in set of settings to revert VirtualBox 6.0+'s grammar and allow the following grammar back:

- `Master` drive
- `Slave` drive

This feature is not expected to be used much. It is just done, because it could be done, and because this project is a restoration of VirtualBox.
